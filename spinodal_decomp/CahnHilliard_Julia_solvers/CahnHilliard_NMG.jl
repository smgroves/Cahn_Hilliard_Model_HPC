# Julia implementation of a Multigrid solver for the Cahn-Hilliard equation with various optimizations for performance (particularly memory allocation)
# Author: Sarah Groves
# October 8, 2024

#=================================================
# Summary of Optimizations:
# [ ] Preallocate arrays and pass them to functions.
# [ ] Use in-place operations and @. for broadcasting.
# [ ] Add @inbounds and @simd for loop optimization.
# [ ] Use StaticArrays for small fixed-size arrays.
# [ ] Replace global constants with function arguments.
# [ ] Use @views to avoid array copying.
# [ ] Profile and benchmark to identify bottlenecks.
# [ ] Access arrays in a column-major order.
# [ ] Precompute and reuse frequently calculated constants.
# [ ] Consider SparseArrays for sparse matrices.
# [ ] Ensure type stability with type annotations.

This function uses the nonlinear multigrid method to solve the Cahn-Hilliard equation for a specified number of time steps of size dt.

    REQUIRED INPUT
        phi0 = Initial field of chemical states in the domain, created by ch_initialization.

    OPTIONAL INPUT
        t_iter = Number of time steps simulated. Default = 1e3.
        dt = Time step. Default = 2.5e-5 characteristic times.
        solver_iter = Number of solver iterations per time step. Default = 1e4.
        tol = Solver tolerance per time step. Default = 1e-5.
        dt_out = Spacing of time steps output to phi_t as a multidimensional
           array (if less than 1e9 elements) or printed file (if greater than
           1e9 elements). Default = 1, to output every time step. 
        m = Number of mesh points over which the interface exists. Default = 4. 
        epsilon2 = Squared interfacial transition distance; if specified,
           m will be overwritten. Default = nan (do not overwrite m).
        boundary = Boundary conditions for the simulation:
           'periodic' (default) - flux on one domain border equals negative flux on the opposite border.
           'neumann' - zero flux on the domain borders.
        c_relax = Number of smoothing relaxations done at the start and end
           of each V-cycle. Default = 2.
        domain = Vector of rightmost and leftmost grid points in x and y.
           Format: [xright xleft yright yleft]. Default = [1 0 1 0].
        printres = Logical to print solver residuals to a file. Default = false.
        printphi = Logical to print phi to a file regardless of whether or 
           not it can be saved as a multidimensional array. Default = false.
         pathname = Name of the path to which phi is printed. Default = 'cd'. May include a prefix for the filename.

    OUTPUT
        t_out = Time corresponding to the dt time step outputs.
        phi_t = Multidimensional array of phi over t_out.
        delta_mass_t = Vector of mass change over t_out.
        E_t = Vector of relative energy over t_out.
