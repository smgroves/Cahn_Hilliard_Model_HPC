function phi_new = fd_solver(phi_old,nx,ny,xright,xleft,yright,yleft, ...

%This function uses the finite difference (Euler) method to solve the 
%Cahn-Hilliard equation for the next time step.
%
%INPUTS
    %phi_old = Prior chemical state.
    %nx = Number of grid points in x.
    %ny = Number of grid points in y.
    %xright = Rightmost grid point in x.
    %xleft = Leftmost grid point in x.
    %yright = Rightmost gridpoint in y.
    %yleft = Leftmost gridpoint in y.
    %dt = Time step.
    %epsilon2 = Squared interfacial transition distance (see Ïµ^2 term in Lee et al., Mathematics 2020)
    %boundary = 'periodic' or 'neumann' boundary conditions.
    %printres = Logical to print residuals to file.
%
%OUTPUT
    %phi_new = Next chemical state.
